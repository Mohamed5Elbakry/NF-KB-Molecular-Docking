# NF-KB-Molecular-Docking
NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) is a kinase that activates the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways to control transcriptional expression of certain proteins such as cytokines, chemokines and NF-κB signaling molecules. Many advances have been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which the stability of NIK is regulated to affect downstream signaling. Genetic mouse models suggest that NIK has an essential role in regulation of the immune system as well as in the bone microenvironment. Increasing evidence links NIK to the tumorigenesis of hematological cancers, such as multiple myeloma, and solid tumors, such as pancreatic carcinoma and melanoma. Understanding the mechanism by which NIK is de-regulated will potentially provide therapeutic options for certain diseases such as autoimmunity and cancer
